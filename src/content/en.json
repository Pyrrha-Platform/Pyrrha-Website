  "informationTitle": "What is Pyrrha?",
  "informationFirstPara": "Pyrrha is an Internet-of-Things (IoT) and data science solution that measures environmental toxins and provides individualized recommendations based on real-time data and long-term averaging. It is the open source core of the Prometeo Platform that won the Call for Code Global Challenge in 2019.",

  "sensorDescription1": "A two-way system that collects toxin readings, analyzes them, and sends actionable data back",
  "Arch-Description1": "1. The firefighter logs into the ruggedized smartphone via IBM App ID. Devices are paired through Bluetooth.",
  "Arch-Description2": "2. The device sensors capture toxin levels. The device sends stored readings to the phone at regular intervals.",
  "Arch-Description3": "3. The mobile application relays data to the IBM IoT platform.",
  "Arch-Description4": "4. The MQTT client service listens for incoming messages from the IBM IoT platform.",
  "Arch-Description5": "5. The MQTT client stores the data in the MariaDB relational database.",
  "Arch-Description6": "6. The MQTT client sends the data to the WebSocket server.",
  "Arch-Description7": "7. The Rules-Decision service wakes up every minute to calculate the 10 mins, 30 mins, 60 mins, 4 hours, and 8 hours time-weighted averages for each gas.",
  "Arch-Description8": "8. The dashboard queries the database to show the historical data.",
  "Arch-Description9": "9. The dashboard connects to the WebSocket Server to show live data and alerts the user if the levels go above certain pre-determined thresholds.",
  "Arch-Description10": "10. The command center can view the dashboard using the web browser on a laptop or tablet.",
  "Arch-Description11": "11. The mobile application regularly requests firefighter status from the Rules-Decision service and shows the result using the LED on the hardware device and phone or watch vibrations.",

  "sensorTitle1": "Pyrrha technology",
  "sensorDescription2": "Pyrrha device: Collects key data: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, temperature, and humidity readings",
  "sensorDescription3": "Cloud dashboard: Shows real-time alerts and averages over time (10min, 30min, 1hr, 4hr, 8hr)",

  "sensorTitle2": "Pyrrha in action",
  "sensorDescription4": "Pyrrha v1 - Prometeo v3 field test with GRAF firefighters in Catalonia, 1Q 2021, building upon earlier tests of v2 in 1Q 2020.",
  "TestingTarget": "Test goals:",
  "TestingTargetA": "A. Collect data from firefighters during controlled burn",
  "TestingTargetB": "B. Evaluate latest case design, size, weight, and allocation",
  "TestingTargetC": "C. Assess feedback and suggestions from firefighters",

  "Results": "Results:",
  "ResultsA": "A. Store temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide readings from 10 firefighters over 2 days",
  "ResultsB": "B. Study case ergonomics, durability, reliability, and robustness metrics",
  "ResultsC": "C. Capture design feedback and additional non-functional ideas for the device",
